            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>
                The automation and advancement of instrumental equipment in analytical laboratories have enabled the acquisition of large volumes of data in very short periods. However, these data do not always translate directly into useful information and often require complex interpretation. In this context, Chemometrics has established itself as an essential discipline, employing mathematical and statistical methods to design, optimize, and interpret data, thereby extracting the maximum possible chemical information.
              </p>
            
              <p>
                With the advancement of artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning (ML), Chemometrics has undergone a revolution. These tools allow systems to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. This approach is particularly relevant in various fields within Forensic Chemistry, such as food authentication and accelerant investigation in fires, which require increasingly efficient and sustainable solutions to address the growing challenges they face.
              </p>
            
              <p>
                The detection and quantification of adulterants in food, as well as the detection of ignitable liquid residues (ILRs) in fire debris, are particularly complex tasks due to the variability of the matrices involved. In the case of food adulteration, products like juices or honey can contain a wide range of compounds, which in low concentrations are difficult to identify. Similarly, in the investigation of allegedly intentional fires, a key point in determining the cause of the fire is establishing the presence of possible ILRs in the fire debris. In most cases, ILRs are found at trace levels and mixed with a multitude of combustion-derived compounds that can mask the key signals for their identification.
              </p>
            
              <p>
                Conventional methods for addressing these challenges focus on identifying target compounds or markers, generally through chromatographic techniques, such as liquid or gas chromatography coupled with mass detectors. However, this approach has drawbacks, such as exhaustive sample preparation, high cost, and the need for a high level of analyst expertise.
              </p>
            
              <p>
                In this context, spectroscopic techniques, such as Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), Visible – Near Infrared (Vis-NIR), or electronic noses that analyze the headspace, such as HS-GC-IMS (Headspace - Gas Chromatography - Ion Mobility Spectrometry) or sensor array-based devices, offer an efficient and versatile alternative. These techniques allow for the generation of global profiles or characteristic fingerprints for each type of sample without the need to identify individual compounds, thus streamlining the analysis process. They also provide numerous advantages, such as rapid analysis, low cost, ease of use, minimal sample preparation, and they generate no waste or use solvents, which aligns with the principles of Green Chemistry. Furthermore, these spectroscopic techniques offer high portability, a significant advantage as they enable in situ analyses, minimizing potential errors or contamination associated with sample conservation and transport.
              </p>
            
              <p>
                However, these spectroscopic techniques generate large volumes of data, making it essential to integrate ML algorithms to extract and analyze the characteristic fingerprints of each type of sample. This integration not only allows for more efficient interpretation of results but also automates the process, eliminating subjectivity in the analysis and reducing both time and operational costs. While linear ML techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) are sometimes sufficient, in the case of chemically complex samples, more advanced nonlinear techniques like Random Forest (RF) or Support Vector Machines (SVM) have proven particularly useful. These techniques not only expand the possibilities for correlating results but also allow for the identification of patterns and the development of predictive models for objective and automated decision-making.
              </p>
            
              <p>
                Based on all the above, this Doctoral Thesis aims to apply ML-based tools for the development of descriptive, prescriptive, or predictive models that enable the rapid and automated characterization of samples of interest in Forensic Chemistry through the use of spectroscopic techniques that generate global profiles. Specifically, Vis-NIR, FTIR, and HS-GC-IMS spectroscopy are combined with ML algorithms for the authentication of juice samples, and Vis-NIR spectroscopy is applied to honey samples. Models for the detection of ILRs in fire debris have also been created using data generated by an electronic nose composed of a sensor array, as well as by HS-GC-IMS.
              </p>
            
              <p>
                Additionally, this freely accessible website has been developed to share the best models obtained, thus facilitating the characterization of these forensic chemistry samples for other users. Among the available models for detecting adulteration in juices and honey are LDA, SVM, and RF-based models, which correctly identified over 95% of adulterations depending on the spectroscopic technique used and the sample analyzed. For the quantification of adulteration levels, the SVM-based model yielded the best results, with R² values above 0.98 and RMSE below 1.85 in all cases. Regarding the detection of ILRs, the available models classified samples correctly in over 95% of cases, regardless of the spectroscopic technique used (sensor array-based electronic nose and HS-GC-IMS).
              </p>
            
              <p>
                In addition to the advantages associated with the spectroscopic techniques themselves, the methodology proposed in this Doctoral Thesis automates result interpretation, providing greater objectivity. Therefore, an innovative, efficient, and accessible alternative for analysis and quality control is proposed, which not only optimizes forensic chemistry processes but also contributes to the advancement of more sustainable and technologically advanced practices in analytical laboratories across industries, research centers, and administrations tasked with carrying out these analyses.

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p> Nowadays, one of the most pressing challenges in the Forensic Sciences is the detection of fraudulent practices. In this context, the application of advanced data analysis methods, such as machine learning (ML), has become increasingly crucial. Combining traditional analytical techniques with ML, it is possible to enhance the reliability, speed, and objectivity of the results, while overcoming the limitations posed by conventional methodologies. This research contributes to these developments by proposing innovative approaches that focus on food adulteration and fire investigation.</p>
              <p>
                One of the major issues facing the food industry is the detection of fraud in high-value products such as juices and honey. Despite strict European regulations, there has been an increase in the adulteration of both products through blending with lower-value substitutes, making detection by traditional analytical methods challenging. These methods primarily rely on the identification of individual compounds, which is often insufficient. Food adulteration is an illegal practice that not only constitutes economic fraud by selling products at prices that do not match their true quality, but it can also have serious health implications for consumers who are unaware of the actual composition of the products. For this reason, Food Forensic Chemistry, an emerging branch of Forensic Chemistry, aims to detect such fraudulent practices and ensure the authenticity of food products.
              </p>
            
              <p>
                Similarly, in fire investigations, detecting ignitable liquid residues (ILRs) among fire debris is crucial for determining the cause of a fire, especially when arson is suspected. The identification of ILRs can serve as forensic evidence to establish both the intent behind a fire and the potential culpability of a suspect. The determination of the presence and type of ILRs is traditionally based on identifying specific compounds by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS). However, the identification of these residues remains a challenge due to numerous factors that may affect the correct interpretation of the results, such as the destructive nature of the fire itself, contamination or interference from combustion products, large amounts of water or extinguishing agents used during firefighting, and the effects of evaporation or biodegradation.
              </p>
            
              <p>
                In this context, over recent years, advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly in ML, have revolutionized data analysis. These developments have enhanced the ability to automate and optimize a wide variety of processes in these fields. MLg has facilitated an innovative approach in the use of traditional analytical techniques, allowing for efficient management and analysis of large datasets that were previously impossible to process with conventional methods.
              </p>
            
              <p>
                Based on the above, this research aims to integrate advanced ML tools with spectroscopic data obtained from various analytical techniques, such as FTIR, Vis-NIR, and electronic nose (E-nose), including sensor arrays and HS-GC-IMS. The objective is to characterize the samples in an automated and objective manner, focusing on global profiles rather than individual compounds. Therefore, the novelty of this study lies not only in the application of different ML algorithms for data management and analysis but also in the automation of result interpretation. This is justified by the need to develop innovative methodologies that enhance forensic processes while promoting more efficient and sustainable practices.
              </p>
            
              <p>
                This research proposes a multi-faceted approach that addresses two key areas:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    First, it conducts a detailed analysis of forensic samples. On the one hand, food samples, specifically juices and honey, are analyzed using spectroscopic techniques such as FTIR, Vis-NIR, and an E-nose sistem based on HS-GC-IMS. On the other hand, ILRs from fire debris are analyzed using two E-noses systems: one based on HS-GC-IMS and the other using a sensor array.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Secondly, the research integrates the data generated by these spectroscopic techniques with machine learning algorithms. This combination allows for the development of robust and automated predictive models. In the case of juices and honey, the models focus on the detection and quantification of adulteration, improving both the safety and quality of the products while providing tools to minimize food fraud. Regarding ILRs in fire debris, the models are designed to identify the presence or absence of ignitable liquids (ILs) and to determine the type of IL involved in igniting the fire, providing critical information for establishing the intent in a forensic investigation.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
            
              <p>
                The ultimate motivation of this Doctoral Thesis is to deepen these methodologies and open new possibilities for their application in research laboratories, industries, administrations, and reference centers. The implementation of these techniques has the potential to replace or complement traditional analytical methods, making them more accessible, faster, cost-effective, and sustainable. Furthermore, these methodologies offer greater portability and objectivity, which would significantly contribute to advancing knowledge in the field of Forensic Chemistry.

            <h4 style="color: #3498db;">4.1.1 Exploratory Analysis</h4>
            <p> The visualization of spectroscopic data is crucial for understanding the inherent differences between samples and identifying potential patterns across various analytical techniques. In this study, three spectroscopic methods—FTIR, Vis-NIR, and IMS—were employed to differentiate different juice types. The spectral data serve as the foundation for subsequent analyses such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA), providing an overview of the variability among the samples and enabling the identification of key distinctions in their chemical compositions.</p>            
            <!-- ESPECTROS -->
            <h5>Spectra</h5>
            <p>The plots below (Figure 1) display the spectra for each of the systems: FTIR, IMS, and NIR, respectively. Notably, for the NIR spectra, the first derivative and a Savitzky–Golay smoothing filter (polynomial degree 3 and window size 11) was applied to enhance signal clarity and reduce noise. It is also important to remember that the IMS detector was an HS-GC-IMS used as an electronic Nose. Therefore, for all analyses as well as for visualization, the IMSS (IMS Sum Spectrum) was used, where the chromatographic information is eliminated. The samples have been colored according to the type of fruit: pineapple juice (yellow), apple juice (red), grape juice (green), and orange juice (orange). The interactive nature of these plots allows users to zoom in, hover over data points to reveal sample names, or focus the analysis by clicking on specific labels in the legend.</p>
            <p>In complex matrices such as juices, the spectral differences between samples can often be subtle, making it challenging to identify a small number of markers for effective discrimination. This subtlety is particularly notable when analyzing overlapping chemical profiles, as is common in fruit juices. The use of pre-processing techniques, such as derivative analysis and smoothing filters, is essential for enhancing minor spectral variations, but the overall difficulty in identifying clear markers underscores the importance of employing others multivariate analysis methods like PCA and HCA for deeper insight.</p>

            <!-- PCA -->
            <h5>Principal Components Analysis (PCA)</h5>
            <p>PCA was applied to reduce the dimensionality of the spectroscopic data, allowing for easier visualization of the variability between the juice samples. As shown in Figure 2, PCA successfully separates grape juice from the other juices, particularly in FTIR (Figure 2A) and IMS (Figure 2B), where the grape juice occupies a distinct position along the first principal component (PC1). This highlights significant spectral differences between grape juice and the other juices, such as apple, pineapple, and orange.</p>
            <p>In contrast, Vis-NIR (Figure 2C) displays a different trend, with grape juice clustering closer to apple juice in the principal component space, suggesting greater similarity in their spectral profiles. This may indicate that Vis-NIR has a lower capacity to distinguish between grape juice and the other juices compared to FTIR and IMS. Since grape juice was used as the adulterant, this observation may have implications for the detection of adulteration.</p>
            <p>Overall, all three techniques demonstrated varying degrees of success in differentiating the juices based on their principal components. FTIR and IMS showed clearer separations, while Vis-NIR displayed some overlap between certain juice types.</p>            <div style="text-align: center;"> <!-- Estilo para centrar el botón -->

            <h5>Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)</h5>
            <p>The HCA results, presented in Figure 3, show dendrograms for each of the three techniques, revealing patterns consistent with the PCA findings. Both FTIR (Figure 3A) and IMS (Figure 3B) successfully group the juice samples into distinct clusters. FTIR, in particular, perfectly separates the four main juice types into individual clusters, with further subclusters identifying samples by brand. IMS also shows a similar trend, though the grape juice is further divided into two distinct clusters based on the brand, indicating potential differences in their spectral profiles.</p>
            <p>Vis-NIR (Figure 3C), however, shows a more diffuse classification pattern. While some grouping according to juice type is observed, the separation is not as clear as in FTIR and IMS. Similar to the PCA results, apple juice appears closer to the grape juice adulterant, and some subclusters are mixed. Pineapple juice is mostly grouped together, although one sample, "P_CA_1_R1", is separated from the main cluster.</p>

            <p>In summary, the spectroscopic data from all three techniques show a tendency to cluster the samples by juice type, though the clarity of the clustering is stronger in FTIR and IMS. This suggests that these two techniques may perform better in detecting juice adulteration.</p>
            <p>While both PCA and HCA yield similar results, it is important to note that they serve different purposes. PCA reduces the dimensionality of the data, highlighting the key components that explain the most variability, while HCA is a clustering technique that groups samples based on their similarity. Together, these methods provide complementary insights into the dataset, enhancing the overall understanding of the spectroscopic differences between the juice samples.</p>

            <h4 style="color: #3498db;"> 4.1.2 Classification Models for Adulteration Detection</h4>
            <p>The classification models trained for adulteration detection are represented in an interactive table (Table 1) as well as in a bar chart (Figure 4), which shows the performance of each model (SVM, RF, and LDA) across the different spectroscopic techniques (Vis-NIR, FTIR, and IMS). The performance is measured in terms of classification accuracy, calculated as the percentage of correctly classified samples in the test set, which comprises 25% of the total samples.</p>
            <p>As depicted, the FTIR data delivers the best results, with SVM and LDA achieving 100% classification accuracy, while RF closely follows with 97.67%. This suggests that FTIR is the most robust technique for adulteration detection, providing high classification accuracy regardless of the model employed.</p>
            <p>Vis-NIR also shows strong results, with LDA and RF both reaching 97.67% accuracy. However, SVM lags behind, achieving only 88.37%, indicating that this model is less effective when using Vis-NIR. While Vis-NIR still delivers acceptable performance, it is not as consistent as FTIR, especially with the SVM model, which experiences a significant drop in accuracy.</p>
            <p>In contrast, the IMS data yields lower overall performance compared to FTIR and Vis-NIR. However, SVM achieves the highest classification accuracy with this technique at 95.45%, followed by LDA with 93.18% and RF with 90.91%. These results indicate that although IMS is less robust than FTIR, SVM adapts particularly well to this dataset, providing high accuracy.</p>
            <p>Comparing the models, LDA proves to be the most robust, consistently performing well across all spectroscopic techniques. SVM, on the other hand, shows more variability, underperforming with Vis-NIR but excelling with FTIR and reaching the highest classification accuracy with IMS. RF, while also providing solid results, is slightly less consistent than LDA.</p>

            <p>In conclusion, FTIR emerges as the most suitable technique for detecting adulterations in the various juice types (orange, pineapple, and apple) when mixed with grape juice, yielding the highest performance across all models. Among the models, LDA stands out for its consistent performance, while SVM, though more variable, performs exceptionally well with FTIR and IMS. RF maintains stable results, with some variations depending on the technique used.</p>

            <h4 style="color: #3498db;"> 4.1.3 Regression Models for Adulteration Quantification</h4>
            <p>The regression models trained to predict the percentage of adulteration using different spectroscopic techniques (Vis-NIR, FTIR, and IMS) have been evaluated based on their R² and RMSE metrics, as shown in Figure 5 as well as in Table 2. Again, these metrics were calculated using the test set, which represents 25% of the total samples.</p>
            <p>The results clearly demonstrate FTIR as the leading technique in terms of performance metrics. The SVR model achieved the best results with an RMSE of 1.243 and an R² of 0.995, closely followed by PLS with an RMSE of 1.357 and an R² of 0.993. Although RF performed slightly worse, it still produced acceptable results with an RMSE of 3.873 and an R² of 0.973. This positions FTIR as the most consistent and effective technique among the three.</p>
            <p>For Vis-NIR, the results were more variable depending on the model used. SVR again showed the best performance with an RMSE of 1.683 and an R² of 0.989, suggesting a strong ability to capture the relationship between variables. However, PLS and RF performed significantly worse, with RMSE values of 4.388 and 7.223, respectively.</p>
            <p>A similar trend is observed with IMS, where SVR leads with an RMSE of 1.831 and an R² of 0.987, while PLS and RF show considerably lower performance (RMSE of 8.431 and 6.003, respectively). These results indicate that while Vis-NIR and IMS can be useful, their effectiveness heavily depends on the regression model employed, with SVR consistently outperforming the others.</p>

            <p> All three techniques (FTIR, Vis-NIR, and IMS) offer clear advantages: they are cost-effective, rapid, and non-destructive, making them ideal for industrial applications. Integrating these techniques with ML algorithms enables automation of the adulteration detection and quantification process, improving both the efficiency and speed of analyses.</p>
            <p> Based on the results, FTIR provides the best outcomes in identifying and quantifying adulterations, followed by Vis-NIR and IMS, which show similar performances. However, FTIR requires additional sample pretreatment, such as filtering before analysis, and the sample volume used in this study was 10 mL. Although these steps do not represent a significant limitation, it is worth noting that IMS and Vis-NIR do not require such filtering and also need smaller sample volumes. In the beverage industry, where resource optimization is crucial, these characteristics may offer a significant advantage.</p>

            <div id="chapter4_2_content" style="display:none; padding-left: 20px;">
                <p>This chapter consists of a single article, which explores the efficacy of combining Vis-NIR spectroscopy with ML algorithms for the detection and quantification of adulterations in honeys. The article is as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Article i: Rapid and Automated Method for Detecting and Quantifying Adulterations in High-Quality Honey Using Vis-NIRs in Combination with Machine Learning (Foods 2023).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The results obtained in this study highlight the advantages of using non-linear classification models, such as SVM and RF, over linear models like LDA. Both SVM and RF achieved a classification accuracy of 100% in detecting adulteration in single-origin honey (orange blossom or sunflower) adulterated with multifloral honey, demonstrating the efficacy of these techniques in addressing complex multivariate problems.</p> 
                <p>Regarding the quantification of the percentage of adulteration, the best performance among the tested models (PLS, SVR, RF, Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net) was achieved with the SVR model, reaching an R² of 0.991 and an RMSE of 1.894. These results confirm the ability of SVR to accurately quantify the percentage of adulteration present in honey samples.</p>
                <p>It is noteworthy that in previous studies on the quantification of adulterations in juices, the SVR model also demonstrated the best performance. This evidence indicates that, regardless of the type of sample analyzed or the various techniques applied, the SVR model consistently offers superior performance compared to the others.</p>

            <div id="chapter4_3_content" style="display:none; padding-left: 20px;">
                <p>This chapter focuses on the detection and identification of ILRs in fire debris, even in the presence of interfering substrates that complicate the analysis. Two complementary studies are presented: the first, already published, utilizes an IMS-based electronic nose, while the second, detailed in Chapter 4.3 of this Doctoral Thesis, employs an electronic nose equipped with a sensor array. The article are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Article i: Machine Learning Approaches over Ion Mobility Spectra for the Discrimination of Ignitable Liquids Residues from Interfering Substrates (Talanta Open 2022).</li>
                    <li>Article i: Smart Portable Electronic Nose System in Combination with Machine Learning Algorithms for the Intelligent Discrimination of Ignitable Liquids Residues in Interfering Matrix (Unpublished).</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 style="color: #3498db;"> 4.3.1 Classification models for detecting presence/absence of ILRs</h4>
                <p> Both studies investigate the ability of E-noses systems to discriminate between ILRs in interfering materials, particularly petroleum-derived substrates, which often share similar signals with pure ILs. The critical first step in both works is the detection of ILRs in fire debris, providing crucial information for forensic analysts in reconstructing the event and assessing the intent behind the fire. To accomplish this, data obtained from both techniques, IMS and sensor array E-nose systems, were combine with ML algorithms (SVM, RF, and LDA) to classify the samples based on the presence or absence of ILRs.</p> 
                <p> A summary of performance metrics, measured in terms of classification accuracy on the test set (25% of the total samples, 90 samples), is presented in Table 3 as well as Figure 6. In the sensor-based electronic nose, a variable reduction was applied using the Boruta algorithm, allowing the evaluation of performance on both the complete matrix and the reduced matrix. As can be seen in Figure 5, the SVM and RF models achieved 100% accuracy in identifying ILRs across all data matrices, demonstrating the effectiveness of these configurations in fire debris analysis.</p>
                <p> In contrast, the LDA model showed a decrease in accuracy, achieving 100% correct classification only when using the reduced matrix of the sensor array system. When using the complete matrix, LDA’s performance was significantly affected, suggesting that the model tends to overfit when too many variables are included, especially if they are non-informative or highly correlated. Additionally, with the IMS dataset, LDA achieved an accuracy of 86.67%, reinforcing the idea that this algorithm is less suitable for handling complex or highly correlated datasets.</p>

                <h4 style="color: #3498db;"> 4.3.2 Classification models for ILRs type detection</h4>
                <p> After training the algorithms to detect the presence of ILRs, the next step was to develop models capable of classifying the specific type of ILs used, which is essential for understanding the origin and potential cause of the fire. The same ML algorithms were applied to the different data matrices, and a summary of the accuracy results for the test set is presented in Figure 7 as well as in Table 4.</p>               
                <p> For the E-nose based on sensor array, three data matrices were evaluated: a complete matrix with all available variables, a reduced matrix with variables selected by the Boruta algorithm (SO₂, CO, H₂S, IRR, NO₂, and TBM), and a further reduced matrix excluding NO₂ and TBM. These configurations allowed for the evaluation of how variable selection impacts model performance in identifying specific ILRs. As can be seen in Figure 7, the E-nose based on IMS generally provided better performance than the sensor array. When using IMS, the LDA model correctly classified 97.22% of the samples. However, with the sensor array system, the accuracy dropped to 77.78% when the complete sensor matrix was used, indicating that introducing more variables reduced performance. Therefore, the highest accuracy of 87.5% was obtained with the reduced sensor matrix.</p>
                <p> The RF model exhibited a similar trend, reaching 100% accuracy with IMS data. However, its accuracy decreased to 90.28% when using the complete sensor matrix but improved to 97.22% with the reduced matrix, underscoring the significance of variable selection in enhancing model performance. In contrast, the SVM model performed better with the sensor array system, achieving 95.83% accuracy with the reduced matrix, despite lower performance with IMS data.</p>

                    <li> The RF model achieves the best performance, regardless of the type of E-nose used.</li>
                    <li> In both LDA and RF models trained with the sensor array system, performance improves as more variables are excluded, suggesting that variable reduction contributes to better model performance.</li>

            <div id="chapter4_4_content" style="display:none; padding-left: 20px;">
                <p>Despite the seemingly different nature of the samples analyzed in this thesis, ranging from food authentication to the identification of ILRs in fire debris, both areas are of interest in Forensic Chemistry. The methodologies and techniques applied are similar, highlighting their potential as fast, efficient, and cost-effective tools for sample characterization across various applications.</p>
                <p>In studies focusing on the detection and quantification of adulterations in honey and juices, the SVR model consistently achieved the best performance, regardless of the spectroscopic technique used (Vis-NIR, FTIR, or IMS). This suggests that SVR is particularly suited for analyzing data from complex matrices, where non-linear relationships between variables may exist, making it a versatile model for a wide range of applications.</p>
                <p>When detecting adulterants, the performance of models such as LDA varied depending on the sample and technique. For example, LDA performed poorly in detecting adulterants in honey using Vis-NIR, but showed better results when applied to juice adulteration detection. This highlights the importance of selecting both the appropriate analytical technique and ML algorithm based on the specific characteristics of the data.</p>
                <p>In fire debris studies, the E-nose based on IMS demonstrated superior performance, particularly in identifying ILRs types. However, the E-nose based on sensor array provided comparable results, with advantages such as simplicity, low energy consumption, and portability. These features make sensor arrays an attractive option for rapid, on-site forensic analysis.</p>

        <p><strong>It can be concluded that:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li> Electronic noses based on both IMS and sensor arrays have proven effective in detecting the presence of ILRs in post-fire scenarios, even in the presence of interfering substrates. Machine learning models (SVM, RF, and LDA) applied to the obtained data enabled accurate classification of the samples based on the presence or absence of ILRs, with RF and SVM achieving 100% accuracy in certain configurations of both techniques.</a></li>
            <li> The electronic nose based on IMS demonstrated superior performance in identifying specific types of ILRs, achieving 100% accuracy when coupled with the RF model. However, the sensor array-based system, although slightly lower in accuracy, offers practical advantages such as lower cost, simplicity, portability, and reduced energy consumption, making it more attractive for in situ forensic applications.</a></li>
            <li> Variable selection using the Boruta algorithm improved the performance of the models in the sensor array-based system, with particularly notable improvements in the RF and LDA models. This highlights the potential of variable reduction techniques while also identifying sensors that are not useful for ILRs detection and identification, allowing for further system optimization.</a></li>
